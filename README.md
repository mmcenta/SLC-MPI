# dSLC
Distributed Single-Linkage Clustering in C++ with MPI. This is an exercise in distributed computing during the INF421 algorithms course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. It features implementations of a few sequential and distributed minimum spanning tree algorithms such as Prim, Kruskal, Boruvka and GHS.

## Requirements

This project requires OpenMPI to run
